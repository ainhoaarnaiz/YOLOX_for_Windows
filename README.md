## Requirements

### Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2019

If you are using CUDA 11.8, you will need to install **Visual Studio Build Tools 2019**. Follow the steps in this video tutorial:

ðŸ‘‰ [Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 Installation Video](https://youtu.be/lW_xccf8uFA?si=MoGhn54JHjQYrTk2)

Make sure the **â€œDesktop development with C++"** workload is installed and that these components are selected:

- MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.29)
- Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)

Once the installation is complete, **restart your computer**.

**Note (not tested):** If you have the latest CUDA (as per May 2025), try installing **Visual Studio Build Tools 2022** and its **â€œDesktop development with C++"** workload (with MSVC v143 and Windows 11 SDK).
